pysb -- a python statusbar
==========================

pysb is a statusbar program, useful with tiled window managers like dwm.
It is intended to provide a vim-airline like
(https://github.com/bling/vim-airline) bar, with information split into areas
and each area being independently updateable.

It has been developed for the author's personal use, and is currently fairly
lacking in documentation and testing. Use at your own risk.
